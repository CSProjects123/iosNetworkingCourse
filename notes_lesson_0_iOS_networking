THESE are my notes from lesson 0 on Udacity's Networking Class:

NSURL - this class lets us represent a URL 

NSURLSession is a class that can manage Network requests on our behalf. You can make modificaions here such as the amount of time you are willing to wait before cancelling a network request. 

NSURLSession.sharedSession() comes preloaded with default settings . It is a singleton. 

IN NSURLSession, all requests are known as tasks. All of these will be a subclass of NSURLSessionTask. 
There are 3 kinds of tasks. 
data --> NSURLSessionDataTask --> directly into memory as NSData
download --> NSURLSessionDownloadTask
upload --> NSURLSessionUpladTask 


We need to "resume" the task explicitly by calling resume.task()

home - command , shift , h 

Use performUiUpdatesOnMain class within the completion handler any time you want to refresh 


By default, only https is allwed. Use the info.plist file to change this ( adding App transport security settings  --> allow arbitart loads  = YES )















							QUESTIONS - go over after the lesson is complete: 

What is happening here at the Network layer - what protocol are we using ? 
What does the exclamation point do exactly? Need to review 
What is a closure in swift?
Go over the jeyword "let" in swift
